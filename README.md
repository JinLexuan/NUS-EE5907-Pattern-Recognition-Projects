Each Matlab files includes one Machine Learning method, consisting of Beta-binomial Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors for classification and discrimination.
The raw data of spam is in spamData.mat.

Original README
%This is EE5907 Programming Assignment

%Assignment1 to Assignment4 indicates Beta-binomial Naive Bayes,Gaussian
%Naive Bayes, Logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors respectively

%Before running any code, spamData.mat should be placed in the same folder
%with them

%The results of Assignment1,3,4 also includes a picture of training and
%testing error rate, which are also included in this folder,named by their
%assignment

%Assignment4 may take about 1min to run, thank you for your time and
